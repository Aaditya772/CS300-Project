# CS300-Project

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that I was solving in the projects for this course were finding the best solution for sorting and organizing course data with a planner program and writing code for the same.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

The approach I took for the problem was creating pseudocode for each of the three potential solutions of using a vector, hash tree, or binary search tree. After writing the pseudocode for each, I performed a Big O runtime analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of each of the three options.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame roadblocks that I encountered while going through the activities or the project by splitting all the work into smaller parts that I can work on each week. This allowed me to spend time to focus on quality for each of the divided parts and also helped me reduce the chances of being overburdened by the large amount of work or running into errors and having to waste time in searching a large amount of data.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs because it has helped learn to explore differant approaches to a single problem. Doing so helps create the most effective solution and also helps reduce the chances of having to scrap entire projects due to realizing or learning later about a better solution instead of exploring and testing/experimenting/planning in the very beginning itself.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by increasing my experience with tackling solutions and designing potential psuedocode for solutions instead of directly attempting to code solutions. This experience will help me explore multiple solutions for a single problem to quickly and efficiently find the best solution without spending unecessary efforts in programming for the same.
